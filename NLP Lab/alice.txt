There was no "One, two, three, and away," 
but they began running when they liked, 
and left off when they liked, 
so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. 
However, when they had been running half an hour or so, 
and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly 
called out "The race is over!" and they all crowded round it, 
panting, and asking, "But who has won?"

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, 
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead 
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), 
while the rest waited in silence. 
At last the Dodo said, "Everybody has won, and all must have prizes."
